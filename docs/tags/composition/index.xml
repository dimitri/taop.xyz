      <title>What is an SQL JOIN?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It took me quite some time before I could reason efficiently about SQL
JOINs. And I must admit, the set theory diagrams never helped me really
understand JOINs in SQL. So today, I want to help you understand JOINs in a
different way, hoping to make the concept click at once for you too!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is an SQL relation?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, understanding SQL is taking you a long time. And some
efforts. It took me years to get a good mental model of how SQL queries are
implemented, and then up from the lower levels, to build a mental model of
how to reason in SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, in most case, I can think in terms of SQL and write queries that
will give me the result set I need. In most cases, because some parts of SQL
are still complex, and I don&amp;rsquo;t practice as much as I used to. In particular,
newer PostgreSQL features are areas I still need to work with more before I
can integrate them in my daily workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to introduce the central concept of the SQL language. What is
an SQL relation?&lt;/p&gt;
