      <description>Photo by Alberto Bigoni unsplash-logoAlberto Bigoni  Today is Black Friday, then followed by a week end that leads directly to Cyber Monday. This is a period where you can find great deals online, with many discounts. I&amp;rsquo;ll make it short, because we all are busy, right?
From today to Monday included my book The Art of PostgreSQL is available at a 50% discount with the coupon “BLACKFRIDAY2019”. Enjoy!</description>
