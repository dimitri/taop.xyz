      <description>&lt;p&gt;The videos from &lt;a href=&#34;https://2019.pgday.paris&#34;&gt;pgDay Paris 2019&lt;/a&gt; are online, and
they look stunning! If you&amp;rsquo;ve been to the conference, you will be able to
enjoy great memories, and if you&amp;rsquo;ve not been there, you can now enjoy all
the fine content that was recorded there at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiOSEHQe91goxYNJDjj2rLw/videos&#34;&gt;Youtube Channel for
pgDay.Paris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year at pgday Paris I tried something new. My presentation was
interactive, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing queries together with the audience,
making mistakes, loosing keystrokes and having all the fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind looking like a fool writing queries in front of an audience
was to show the process behind those elegant queries that we tend to share
in one piece, on a slide where they shine, beautifully indented. We don&amp;rsquo;t
get to those queries writing them like we would prose. It takes multiple
iterations to get there. From something quite simple to something more and
more sophisticated, until we have exactly the result set we are interested
in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
